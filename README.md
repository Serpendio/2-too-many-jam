# Building
To automatically build the project for multiple platforms (Windows and WebGL by default), you can use `Window -> SuperUnityBuild`.  
By default, it should load the project's custom settings.  
Simply scroll to the bottom and press Perform All Enabled Builds. Your builds can then be found in `Builds/` under the main project folder.  

Please try to follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) where possible :)

# Uploading to Itch
Builds should be uploaded as `sincantation-windows.zip` and `sincantation-web.zip`, so that Itch can automatically add them to the Windows and Web update channels, respectively.
